	DaVinci Resolve is the world’s only solution that combines editing, color
	correction, visual effects, motion graphics and audio post production all in
	one software tool! Its elegant, modern interface is fast to learn and easy
	enough for new users, yet powerful for professionals. DaVinci Resolve lets
	you work faster and at a higher quality because you don’t have to learn
	multiple apps or switch software for different tasks. That means you can
	work with camera original quality images throughout the entire process.
	It’s like having your own post production studio in a single app! Best of
	all, by learning DaVinci Resolve, you’re learning how to use the exact same
	tools used by Hollywood professionals!
	Hardware support is limited. Nvidia cards should work fine.
	If you're running a hybrid setup, try with primusrun/optirun.
	This was originally written by Daniel Bermond in blackmagic-decklink-sdk
